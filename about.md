This is an evolving list of Interview Questions for Device Engineers. 

* p-n Junctions
1. Draw the band-diagram of a p-n junction under equilibrium
2. Draw the electric field profile in a planar p-n junction. 
3. How do you calculate the depletion width of a p-n junction ?
4. What happens to the depletion width as a function of:
		* Doping
		* Temperature

* MOSFETs
* BJTs
* Implantation
* Memory (Flash)
* SRAM
